# RandomizedRedundantDCTDenoising

The code is written for demonstration of the paper [1].
In this paper, the DCT-based denoising [2] is accelerated by using a randomized algorithm.
Some modifications improve denoising performance in term of PSNR.

The code is 100x faster than the OpenCV's implementation for the paper [2] (cv::xphoto::dctDenoising).
Optionally, we can use DHT (discrete Walshâ€“Hadamard fransform) for fast computation.
