# RandomizedRedundantDCTDenoising

The code is written for demonstration of the paper [1].
In this paper, the DCT-based denoising [2] is accelerated by using a randomized algorithm.
Some modifications improve denoising performance in term of PSNR.

The code is 100x faster than the OpenCV's implementation (cv::xphoto::dctDenoising) for the paper [2].
For color one megapixel image with Intel XEON X5690 3.47GHz (6 core+HT, dual CPU):
* OpenCV: (16 x 16) 9024 ms, (8 x 8) 5862 ms
* RRDCT : (16 x 16)   40.8 ms, (8 x 8) 39.2 ms
Optionally, we can use DHT (discrete Walshâ€“Hadamard fransform) for fast computation.
The code is tested on OpenCV 3.0 or later and Visual Studio 2013.
