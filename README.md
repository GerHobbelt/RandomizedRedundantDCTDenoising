# RandomizedRedundantDCTDenoising
real-time denoising presented at Siggraph Asia TB 2015.

The code is written for demonstration of the paper [1].
In this paper, the DCT-based denoising [2] is accelerated by using randomized algorithm.
Optionally, we can use DHT (discrete Walshâ€“Hadamard fransform) for fast computation.
